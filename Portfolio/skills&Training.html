                <li>Over the past year, I have gained valuable experience in casual coding using Python, HTML, and CSS. In addition to my hands-on experience, I have also had the opportunity to attend two seminars on programming, which have further enhanced my understanding of these languages and technologies.</li>
                <br>
                <li>I am a hardworking and dedicated individual who is always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge. I have a strong work ethic and am willing to put in the effort to learn and grow as a programmer. In my previous experiences, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to work efficiently and effectively, and I am confident that my strong foundation in these languages and my eagerness to learn will enable me to excel in any programming challenge. I am excited to continue building upon my skills and experience and to take on new and meaningful projects in the future.</li>
